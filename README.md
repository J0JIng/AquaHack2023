### Overview:
Aquaponics Monitoring System for Tilapia and Asian Leafy Greens Farm with an emphasis on inclusivity and social impact.  

### Introduction:
Aquaponics is a sustainable agricultural system that combines aquaculture with hydroponics. It creates a mutually beneficial ecosystem where fish waste provides nutrients for the plants, and the plants help filter and clean the water for the fish. While aquaponics offers numerous benefits, it requires meticulous care to maintain the delicate balance between fish and plants. To streamline the monitoring process and ensure optimal conditions for both Tilapia fish and Asian leafy greens, we have developed an Aquaponics Monitoring System called CloudSensor.

In this proposal, we outline our vision to enhance the social impact of our Aquaponics Monitoring System, CloudSensor, by introducing AquaFeeder focused on positively contributing to the community, with a particular emphasis on children in hospitals. This aims to improve the well-being of the children, promote environmental awareness, and offer valuable educational experiences.

### Key Objectives:

1. Real-time Monitoring:
The system aims to provide real-time data on essential parameters to closely monitor the health and well-being of the fish and plants.

2. Automation:
Automation features are integrated to reduce manual workload and ensure consistent environmental control.

3. Data Analysis:
The collected data is analyzed to gain insights into the system's performance, enabling informed decision-making for improvements.
